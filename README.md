# jp-vocab-quiz

## Description
A web app quiz on JLPT Vocabulary. Requires data file

## Structure
JS, HTML, CSS, Flask

## Current Task
* Create App Logic using TDD
Note: I'm currently running tests using jest. Thus I'm using modules in this version but not in the scrimba version
I need to keep both up to date just in case I have any problems while using modules. Currently I'm in the process
of creating the tests for the initial helper functions (the ones that create the questions). Finish that first.
Afterwards, test manually that the questions come up and can be clicked to show a console log of correct or incorrect.

## Remaining Tasks
* Create flask server
* Create requirements.txt

## Completed Tasks
* Save data in suitable format
* Load data using TDD
* Create github workflow
* Lint server
* Run Github workflow again and fix problems until all stages successful
* Create app markup and styling
